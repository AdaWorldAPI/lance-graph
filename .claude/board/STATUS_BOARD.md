## symbiont-golden-image-harness — the living all-in-one substrate binary + the first runtime edges

The golden image (`crates/symbiont`, workspace-`exclude`d): the full Ada stack in ONE binary, then real cross-crate edges onto the canonical SoA. Plan: `crates/symbiont/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` (PR #555, merged `37cc21b2`).

| D-id | Title | Crate(s) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D0 | Golden image compiles+links (lockstep lance-7) | symbiont | **Shipped** | git-deps build `CARGO_EXIT=0`, unified `lance 7.0.0 / lancedb 0.30.0 / df 53.1 / arrow 58`, binary runs |

| E2 | Parallel SoA sweep at scale (16k boards = 8 MiB, zero-copy) | symbiont/bridge.rs | **Shipped** | `run_scale_demo(16384)` → 8 MiB, all 16384 Energy tenants finite |
| D3-AMX | Domino POC — 16-board AMX 16×16 BF16 Morton-tile cascade + NaN-projection | symbiont/domino.rs | **Shipped** | 3/3 tests green; 256 boards × 16 AMX-16×16 batches × 3-stage BF16 Morton-tile Domino cascade, NaN-clean via the projection surface. Polyfill-only (`ndarray::simd::bf16_tile_gemm_16x16` re-export `05bfea7a` jirak; `f32_to_bf16_batch_rne`; only `morton4` consumer-side). **Ran AVX-512 fallback** — AMX genuinely OFF on this guest (functional probe `/tmp/amxcheck`: XCR0 tile bits 17/18 = 0, `arch_prctl(158)` XTILEDATA = **-95 -EOPNOTSUPP** kernel refuses; CPUID also masked). NOT merely CPUID-masked → cannot be enabled here; a forced byte-encoded TDPBF16PS would fault. AMX dispatch correct + arch_prctl-158 gotcha-safe; fires `[AMX TDPBF16PS]` on an AMX-granted guest. |
| D2 | Kanban loop — pure-SoA slice (version-tick → `NextPhaseScheduler` → `try_advance_phase`) | symbiont/kanban_loop.rs | **Shipped (slice)** | 2/2 tests green; `SymbiontBoard` impls `MailboxSoaView`+`MailboxSoaOwner` over the `Vec<NodeRow>`, a `u32` tick stands in for the Lance subscription; drove `Planning→CognitiveWork[BF16 Domino sweep]→Evaluation→Commit`, Libet anchor on the Σ-crossing, halted absorbing in 3 cycles, NaN-clean. Reuses the COMPLETE contract kanban surface (`KanbanColumn`/`KanbanMove`/`NextPhaseScheduler`/`MailboxSoa{View,Owner}`) — zero new types. **ractor = ownership guarantee** (no messages, no tokio; E-CE64-MB-4 / #477 "nothing transmitted between mailboxes") — already embodied by `SymbiontBoard`'s single `&mut` owner, NOT a deferred message actor. **Trigger is SYNCHRONOUS — the writer fires it:** `VersionScheduler::on_version(&view, DatasetVersion(u64), exec)` is a sync pure function; a batch writer knows the version it committed and fires the kanban update inline (`on_version`→`try_advance_phase`, no async). `surreal_container/tests/scheduler_seam.rs` drives the whole Rubicon arc with plain `#[test]` feeding `DatasetVersion(i)`; `cognitive-shader-driver` `MailboxSoA` test 11 runs the same in-RAM loop (`mailbox_soa.rs:700` "no surreal / ractor message bus needed"). This loop's `u32` tick IS that pattern. Async is ONLY the Lance write I/O + the SUBSCRIPTION variant `LanceVersionScheduler::drive_once` (async because it READS a version it didn't write; shipped, 5 tokio tests). Only `surreal_container::read_via_kv_lance` is a stub. |

## D-HELIX-1 — `crates/helix` golden-spiral Place/Residue codec (zero-dep + optional ndarray-hpc)

**Status:** Shipped (branch `claude/gallant-rubin-Y9pQd`; **61 unit + 6 doctests green** on the default zero-dep build AND under `--features ndarray-hpc`; clippy -D warnings + fmt clean). New standalone crate (empty `[workspace]`, root `exclude`) realising the user's `KNOWLEDGE.md`: `HemispherePoint` (√u equal-area placement) → `CurveRuler` (stride-4-over-17) → `Similarity` (Fisher-Z/arctanh) → `RollingFloor` (256-palette; occupancy-drift + version stamp) → `ResidueEdge` (3-byte endpoint pair) + `DistanceLut` (metric-safe 256×256 L1; `distance_adaptive` vs non-metric `distance_heuristic`) + `prove()` (2-D discrepancy companion to `jc::weyl`). Optional `ndarray-hpc` = batch Fisher-Z via `simd_ln_f32`. ~80% clean-room overlap with CERTIFIED primitives (E-HELIX-OVERLAP / TD-HELIX-OVERLAP-1); consolidation path in `KNOWLEDGE.md`. Process: autoattended — 5 research agents + 4 parallel Sonnet leaf workers + central consolidation. Next (owed): fidelity-vs-ground-truth probe (naive-u8 floor gate ≥0.9980 Pearson, CONJECTURE). **Update (post-#460):** ndarray is now a MANDATORY non-optional **git** dep (codex P2 + directive "ndarray is mandatory for lance-graph"); `simd.rs` always uses `ndarray::simd`; `ndarray-hpc` feature removed. 63 unit + 6 doctests green; clippy/fmt clean. See E-HELIX-NDARRAY-MANDATORY.

## D-A3 — I4x32/I4x64 signed-i4 CAM codec (carrier `pack`/`unpack` + the 256-bit wide carrier)

**Status:** Shipped (branch `claude/jolly-cori-clnf9`; contract lib **562 green**, offline). `I4x32::pack`/`unpack` (two's-complement signed-i4 nibble; even→low/odd→high; saturate `[−8,7]`; sign-agnostic) + new `I4x64` (256-bit / 64 signed dims) + private `sext4`. The carrier is a deterministic 32×/64× **CAM address** + sparse-intensity "smell" — NOT a similarity vector (no vector search, no float; the `{instance,reference}` dual REJECTED, "64" = 64 poles). 33 atoms → dims 0..32. Resolved the 3 stale BLOCKED notes. Plan `.claude/plans/a3-carrier-v1.md` (5-research + 3-brutal sandwich). Next: A4 (CAM-address resolver + `is_signed` + `AtomLane`/`LaneMask` newtypes).

## D-EW64-2 — EpisodicEdges64 MRU promote (Hebbian hot-tier "stronger immediate edges")

| D-id | deliverable | status | PR / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-EW64-2 | `EpisodicEdges64::{promote, strongest}` — MRU slot-order = strength; fire→slot 0, evict coldest (`E-EW64-STRENGTH-IS-CE64-PLASTICITY`) | In PR (claude/jolly-cori-clnf9) | contract lib 533 green (+5); default clippy clean |

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Shipped** | Merged to main. PR column cites the merge commit. |
| **In PR** | PR open, under review. Not yet merged. |
| **In progress** | Active branch, code in flight, not yet PR. |
| **Queued** | Next up; spec is clear; work not started. |
| **Backlog** | Future; still in scope but not yet queued for a phase. |
| **Deferred** | Explicitly parked. Rationale recorded. Will be revisited. |
| **Abandoned** | Removed from scope. Rationale recorded. Will not be revisited. |

Rules:
- New rows APPEND (at the bottom of the relevant section).
- Status field is the ONLY field that gets edited in place.
- When a deliverable ships, record the PR number — never delete the
  row.
- When a deliverable is superseded by a different design, keep the
  row with Status = Abandoned and cite the replacement.

## codec-sweep-via-lab-infra-v1 — JIT-first codec sweep

Active integration plan. 7 Phase 0 deliverables (D0.1–D0.7) + Phases
1–5 queued. One upfront Wire-surface rebuild; every candidate
afterwards is a JIT kernel, not a rebuild. Plan path:
`.claude/plans/codec-sweep-via-lab-infra-v1.md`.

### CI Gate — JC Substrate Proof

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI-JC | `.github/workflows/jc-proof.yml` — runs prove_it on every PR touching `crates/jc/` or `cam.rs` | **In PR** | 5-min timeout, exits 0 = substrate sound |

### Phase 0 — API hardening (partial in PR #225; remainder queued)

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D0.1 | Extend `WireCalibrate` + `WireTensorView` (64-byte-aligned decode, object-oriented methods) | **Shipped** | #227 — 55/55 tests passing |
| D0.2 | `WireTokenAgreement` endpoint stub — I11 cert gate (Phase 0 surface, Phase 2 harness) | **In PR** | branch — `WireTokenAgreement` + `WireTokenAgreementResult` + `WireBaseline` DTOs + 3 round-trip tests. Stub handler returns `stub:true` / `backend:"stub"` until D2.1–D2.3 wire real decode-and-compare. |
| D0.3 | `WireSweep` streaming endpoint + Lance append stub | **In PR** | branch — `WireSweepGrid` + `cardinality()` + `enumerate()` → `Vec<WireCodecParams>` + `WireMeasure` enum + `WireSweepRequest` / `WireSweepResult` / `WireSweepResponse` DTOs + 5 tests. Streaming handler + Lance writer defer to Phase 3 D3.1. |
| D0.4 | Surface freeze (commit + rebuild) | **Ready** | D0.1–D0.7 all Shipped / In PR; freeze fires on merge of this PR. |
| D0.5 | `auto_detect.rs` — `ModelFingerprint` from `config.json` | **In PR** | branch — `auto_detect::{detect, ModelFingerprint, DetectError}` + HF config.json parser + per-architecture lane/distance heuristics (llama/qwen3/bert/modernbert/xlm-roberta/generic) + 8 tests. CODING_PRACTICES gap 1 remediated. |
| D0.6 | `CodecParamsBuilder` fluent API | **Shipped** | #225 — `contract::cam` +290 LOC of codec-params types, 14 tests (CODING_PRACTICES gap 3) |
| D0.7 | Precision-ladder validation (OPQ↔BF16x32, Hadamard pow2, overfit guard) | **Shipped** | #225 — `CodecParamsError` at `.build()` BEFORE JIT compile |

### Phase 1 — JIT codec kernels

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1.1 | `CodecKernelCache` — structural cache layer (generic over handle) | **In PR** | branch — `CodecKernelCache<H>` + `StubKernel` + `get_or_compile` / `try_get_or_compile` with RwLock concurrent-safe double-check + compile/hit/ratio counters + 9 tests. Scaffold ships NOW; D1.1b Cranelift IR emission follows. |
| D1.1b | Adapter: `CodecKernelEngine` wrapping `ndarray::hpc::jitson_cranelift::JitEngine` with two-phase BUILD/RUN lifecycle (Arc-freeze). CodecParams → CodecScanParams adapter + codec-specific IR emission in jitson_cranelift/scan_jit analog | **Queued** | target ~250 LOC; `JitEngine` already ships (`/home/user/ndarray/src/hpc/jitson_cranelift/engine.rs`); the work is the CodecParams adapter + codec-specific JITSON template |
| D1.2 | Rotation primitives: Identity / Hadamard / OPQ as `RotationKernel` impls | **In PR** | branch — `RotationKernel` trait (Send+Sync+Debug, object-safe) + `IdentityRotation` (no-op) + `HadamardRotation` (real Sylvester butterfly, O(N log N) in-place, norm²-scaling verified) + `OpqRotationStub` (matrix-blob-id placeholder for D1.1b) + `build(&Rotation, dim)` factory + `RotationError` typed errors + 15 tests. Hadamard stays at Tier-3 F32x16 (add/sub, not matmul → no AMX benefit per Rule C). |
| D1.3 | Residual PQ via decode-kernel composition | **In PR** | branch — `DecodeKernel` trait (Send+Sync+Debug, object-safe, encode/decode/signature/bytes_per_row/dim/backend) + `StubDecodeKernel` (byte-exact round-trip for testing) + `ResidualComposer` (base + residual with subtract/add; nests recursively for depth >1) + `DecodeError` typed errors + 9 tests. Scope clarified: hydration/calibration path, NOT cascade inference (cascade uses `p64_bridge::CognitiveShader` per `cognitive-shader-architecture.md` line 582). |

### Phase 2 — Token-agreement harness (I11 cert gate) — Queued

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D2.1 | Token-agreement harness scaffold (reference model stub + top-k comparator + stub result) | **In PR** | branch — `ReferenceModel::{load, stub}` + `TokenAgreementError` + `TopKAgreement::{compare, top1_rate, top5_rate, meets_cert_gate, aggregate}` + `TokenAgreementHarness::{measure_stub, measure_full}` + 13 tests. Real safetensors load + decode loop defer to D2.2. |
| D2.2 | Decode-and-compare loop (top-k, per-layer MSE) | **Queued** | target ~220 LOC |
| D2.3 | Handler wiring for `/v1/shader/token-agreement` | **In PR** | branch — `token_agreement_handler` routes `WireTokenAgreement` → TryFrom(CodecParams) at ingress (precision-ladder + overfit guard fire here) → `ReferenceModel::load` or stub fallback on nonexistent paths → `TokenAgreementHarness::measure_stub()` → `WireTokenAgreementResult { stub:true }`. Route added: `POST /v1/shader/token-agreement`. Phase 0 Wire + Phase 2 harness now round-trip end-to-end. |

### Phase 3 — Sweep driver + Lance logger — Queued

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D3.1 | Server-side sweep handler + Lance fragment append | **In PR** | branch — `sweep_handler` batch mode: enumerates `WireSweepGrid::enumerate()`, validates each via TryFrom(CodecParams) at ingress, returns `WireSweepResponse { results: [WireSweepResult { kernel_hash, stub:true }], cardinality, elapsed_ms }`. SSE streaming + real calibrate/token-agreement per point deferred to D3.1b. Route: `POST /v1/shader/sweep`. |
| D3.2 | Client-side driver + config files | **In PR** | branch — 3 starter YAML configs (`configs/codec/{00_pr220_baseline, 10_wider_codebook, 12_hadamard_pre_rotation}.yaml`), `scripts/codec_sweep.sh` curl wrapper, `configs/codec/README.md`, YAML-shape spec-drift guard test. 118/118 tests pass. |

### Phase 4 — Frontier analysis — Queued

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D4.1 | DataFusion SQL over `sweep_results` Lance | **Queued** | target ~80 LOC |
| D4.2 | Pareto frontier notebook | **Queued** | target ~120 LOC |

### Phase 5 — Graduation — Fires per-candidate

| D-id | Title | Status | PR / Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D5  | Graduation to canonical `OrchestrationBridge` (per winner) | **Queued** | target ~120 LOC per graduation; gate: ICC ≥ 0.99 held-out + token-agreement top1 ≥ 0.99 |

## Prior-art audit (61 + 41 = 102 existing docs)

Before this session, the workspace accumulated 61 `.claude/*.md`
top-level docs + 41 `.claude/prompts/*.md` files across prior
sessions. They are indexed in `.claude/BOOT.md §Existing content`
and `CLAUDE.md §Prior art`, but their individual **status** (still
active / superseded / archival) has not been audited.

Status rows per bucket, not per file (102 rows would drown the
board — use filesystem + INTEGRATION_PLANS + PR_ARC for per-file
history):

| Bucket | Count | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.claude/*.md` top-level calibration reports / handovers / audits / snapshots | 61 | **Indexed** | Pointed at from BOOT.md + CLAUDE.md. Per-file active/superseded status: **Backlog** (needs one-pass audit). |
| `.claude/prompts/*.md` scoped session / probe / handover prompts | 41 | **Indexed** | Pointed at from BOOT.md via `SCOPED_PROMPTS.md` index. Per-file status: **Backlog**. |
| `.claude/knowledge/*.md` structured knowledge | 12 | **Active** | Current; each has `READ BY:` header; used by Knowledge Activation triggers. |
| `.claude/agents/*.md` specialist + meta-agent cards | 24 | **Active** | Current; used by spawning + Knowledge Activation. |
| `.claude/hooks/*.sh` | 2 | **Active** | Wired via settings.json. |
| `.claude/skills/cca2a/*.md` | 3 | **Active** | Current. |
| `.claude/plans/*.md` integration plans | 1 (v1) | **Active** | Elegant herding rocket v1, Phase 1 shipped. |

**Backlog item — prior-art audit.** One-pass sweep across the
61+41 files. Per file: label as active / superseded / archival
with a one-line note. Deliverable = an `ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` that
splits the 102 into current vs historical, plus rename/move of
superseded files into an `archive/` subdirectory. Estimate ~200
LOC of meta work, ~2 hours of reading. **Not urgent**; useful
before the next major planning session.

MUST land before D-ARM-5 wires the proposer to a live `SpoStore`, else the substrate calcifies on thin-but-frequent noise (plan §11.1). **ENGINE EXISTS:** `jc::jirak` (Jirak-Cartan Pillar 5) is the weak-dependence Berry-Esseen rate (`n^(p/2-1)`); this deliverable is the *gate function* (rule → significant?) that derives its threshold from it — NOT a from-scratch Jirak impl.

Integer evidence counts + ppm gates + `TruthU8` (= CausalEdge64 wire). `AerialProposer` impl of `Proposer`.

SIMD target-cpu caveat: real AVX-512/AMX kernels need `-C target-cpu=native`/`x86-64-v4`. v1 (autoencoder) superseded per the user's no-float directive. |

End-to-end test: splat top-k → aerial discovers `occupation→DOLCE-class` → projects the skeleton triple. 41/41 + clippy clean (default + `ndarray-simd`), zero-dep. Float still OFFLINE in jc only (`ewa_sandwich`+`sigma_codebook_probe` ρ=0.9973+`pflug` Lε); aerial online path integer. **Phase 2 (branch `claude/jolly-cori-clnf9-darm14-p2`):** the proposer→hub landing. (a) `OntologyProjector::dolce_id()` — emits the stable `dolce_id` u8 (= basin nibble) the hub routes by, NOT a hardcoded IRI (the OD-DOLCE alignment #442 deferred to this lane; basin ordering already matches `dolce_id::{ENDURANT=0..}`). (b) gated worked example `tests/wikidata_landing.rs` (`--features landing`, opt-in `dev-dep lance-graph-contract` à la jc): splat top-k → aerial recovers all 6 DOLCE basins → lands each on the REAL merged `contract::hhtl::NiblePath` (16ⁿ router, #442) + `class_view::FieldMask` (+`inherit`) + `hash::fnv1a_str` signature. CONFIRMED on data: corpus collapses 6→5 families (film≡tv-series twin), human⊂person inherits path + mask-as-delta, basin preserved. 42/42 default (zero-dep) + landing test green, clippy clean both.

## wikidata-lazy-spine-hydration-v1 — the NiblePath-keyed tiered hydration manager + addressing (the "agnostic lazy world-spine" runtime)

## Update protocol

When a deliverable ships:
1. Edit this file's Status column in place for the row → **Shipped**.
2. Fill in PR / Evidence column with the merge commit or PR #.
3. Append a new section to `PR_ARC_INVENTORY.md` (Added / Locked /
   Deferred / Docs / Confidence).
4. Update `LATEST_STATE.md` (Recently Shipped PRs + Current Inventory
   if types change).

When a deliverable moves phase (e.g. Queued → In progress → In PR):
1. Edit Status column in place. Don't reorder rows.
2. If the move reflects scope correction, also update
   `INTEGRATION_PLANS.md` Status line for the parent plan.

When a new deliverable is added to a plan:
1. Append a new row at the bottom of the plan's section.
2. D-id is sequential in the plan (D12, D13, etc.).
3. Original scope becomes immutable once committed.

When a deliverable is abandoned:
1. Edit Status → **Abandoned**. Don't remove the row.
2. Cite the replacement in Notes.
