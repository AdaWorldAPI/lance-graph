## 1. The substrate-b shape (the integration pattern this doc serves)

A substrate-b integration of lance-graph composes seven cooperating capabilities into a single binary:

1. **Storage** — `lance-graph` (Lance columnar) + Lance versions as the temporal axis (`checkout_version(V)` is the time-travel primitive)
2. **Distributed KV** — `surrealdb` with `kv-lance` feature (PRs `AdaWorldAPI/surrealdb#35` + `#36` merged) OR external TiKV cluster
3. **Search** — Tantivy (Rust-native full-text)
4. **Analytics / OLAP** — DataFusion over Lance versions
5. **Actors / dispatch** — ractor + the mailbox-as-owner topology + `MessagingErr::Saturated` for backpressure (PR `AdaWorldAPI/ractor#1` merged)
6. **In-process event bus** — `lance-graph-callcenter::version_watcher::LanceVersionWatcher` (std::sync Condvar; never tokio per the I-2 invariant)
7. **OIDC / IAM** — external Zitadel (retained as the IdP boundary) + in-proc JWT validation via `auth-plug`

The `lance-graph-planner` (16 strategies + 12 thinking styles + NARS dispatch + the AutocompleteCache) is the compute / rule-evaluation layer that sits on top.

## 2. The three load-bearing primitives substrate-b consumers must understand

### 2.1 Lance versions are the multi-purpose temporal primitive

A single primitive — Lance versions — serves three distinct capabilities a substrate-b consumer would otherwise build separately:

- **Point-in-time query** = `dataset.checkout_version(V_ref)` — pin an immutable snapshot at any version
- **Time-series** = the version log itself — every commit is a versioned event with a timestamp
- **Audit (retention-policy-gated)** = append-only **at write time**, but Lance supports version cleanup (`Dataset::cleanup_old_versions` + the `lance.auto_cleanup.*` settings, Lance 7.0+). The version log is therefore **not guaranteed immutable without explicit retention policy**. For audit-class workloads, consumers MUST configure retention — either by disabling auto-cleanup on the dataset, tagging versions for retention, OR routing audit-class events to a separate append-only sink (signed write-once object store, regulator-grade audit ledger). For regulatory-grade *"cannot be deleted, cannot be manipulated"* guarantees, the external signed sink is **mandatory** — Lance versions alone are NOT a substitute.

This is the substrate-b efficiency claim, with the audit caveat: three capabilities, one primitive — for non-regulatory audit, Lance versions + a retention policy serve. For regulatory audit, the external signed sink remains a separate concern (no claim made). The implications are captured in `STANDING_WAVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 (in substrate-b consumer repos).

### 2.2 Per-element auth = palette256 + Hamming popcount on Binary16K

The substrate-b hot-path auth primitive is bit-op-per-element via `Binary16K = [u64; 256]` (Hamming-compare format) with palette256 as the codebook. The per-vertex `_effectiveReaders` / `_effectiveDevices` bitmap is materialised on write; the per-read check is a Hamming popcount / bit-intersection (uncached, immediate-effect by construction — auth changes take effect at the next commit, no separate cache invalidation).

This is the substrate-b shape for fine-grained per-element authorization. Any consumer wiring auth onto lance-graph entities should use this primitive (per `vsa-switchboard-architecture.md` Layer-2 catalogue + `encoding-ecosystem.md`); do NOT introduce a separate ACL store.

### 2.3 ractor Actor + Lance-version-as-state-machine = the Rubicon phase machine

A substrate-b actor models its lifecycle as a ractor `Actor` whose epistemic state transitions are mirrored by Lance commits. The pattern:

- **State enum** (typed) on the ractor Actor — one variant per epistemic state (e.g. Contemporary / Anachronistic / Spoiler for an awareness-mode dispatch)
- **State-enter side-effect** — entering the Decision state fires the Lance commit; the version bump is the state-transition record
- **Defer-until-transition** — events arriving before the Decision are held; replayed after the version bump
- **Per-state timeouts** — SLA-bounded waits per state; expiry routes through `MessagingErr::Saturated` for backpressure

The architectural payoff: the actor's state history is materialised in the Lance version log (no separate state-machine event store), and the determinism firewall is preserved (each actor commits to its own dataset; no cross-mailbox state coupling). Full pattern in `STANDING_WAVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 in substrate-b consumer repos.

## 3. Capability roadmap — built today / partial / not-yet

| `EpisodicWitness64` SoA column (Phase D) | `soa_view.rs:77 episodic_witness()` accessor | **gated** (offline; needs `cognitive-shader-driver`'s `MailboxSoA<N>`) |

## 4. The migration endpoint contract — substrate-b's dual-stack ground-truth surface

A substrate-b consumer that's replacing an external system needs a uniform API surface exposed by BOTH the substrate-b binary AND the system being replaced, so the same workload can be replayed against each and compared deterministically.

The contract substrate-b consumers should expose (one minimal shape; consumers extend per workload):

```
POST   /v1/entity            create vertex
GET    /v1/entity/:id        read vertex
GET    /v1/entity/:id?at=V   read vertex at Lance version V (historisation)
PUT    /v1/entity/:id        update vertex
DELETE /v1/entity/:id        soft-delete (lifecycle markers, never hard delete)
POST   /v1/edge              create edge
POST   /v1/traverse          multi-hop traversal (lance-graph-planner dispatch)
POST   /v1/query             point query
POST   /v1/graphql           tabular output (DataFusion SQL over Lance versions)
GET    /v1/audit             audit query (DataFusion over Lance version log)
WS     /v1/stream            real-time subscription (LanceVersionWatcher → WS push, Layer-3 tokio)
POST   /v1/dispatch          cognitive dispatch (substrate-b-specific; no comparison)
```

Properties to preserve at every endpoint:
- **Version-pinnable reads** — every read can specify `?at=V` for point-in-time
- **Lifecycle markers, not hard delete** — `revokedAt` / `archivedAt` timestamps; never DROP
- **Real-time subscription via the in-proc bus** — `WS /v1/stream` proxies `LanceVersionWatcher::subscribe()` through to the WebSocket client (Layer-3 tokio outbound)
- **DataFusion is the cold-path SQL** — graphql + audit go through DataFusion over Lance versions; the hot path stays on `lance-graph-planner` strategy dispatch

Substrate-b consumers run dual-stack workload replay against this contract; the §14 acceptance gate (in substrate-b consumer repos' `docs/MIGRATION-COMPARISON-HARNESS.md`) produces a per-endpoint verdict (PASS / DIVERGENT-RECONCILABLE / DIVERGENT-FAULTY / INDETERMINATE).

## 5. Integration patterns that fall out of this shape

### 5.1 Two-and-a-half OLD components collapse to one when substrate-b is the target

A consumer migrating from a separate Historisation layer + a separate time-series database replaces both with Lance versions outright — that part of the design-pattern claim follows from §2.1. **The audit case is conditional:**

- For **non-regulatory** audit (operational logging, compliance-as-best-effort), Lance versions serve IF the retention policy is configured to preserve the audit window (auto-cleanup disabled, versions tagged for retention, or `cleanup_old_versions` not invoked on the audit dataset). Substrate-b consumers SHOULD make this policy explicit in their deployment config.
- For **regulatory-grade** audit ("cannot be deleted, cannot be manipulated" — the kind of guarantee required for compliance frameworks that mandate immutable audit trails), Lance versions alone are NOT a substitute. A separate signed write-once sink (object-storage with object-lock + signature, or a regulator-grade audit ledger) remains a separate concern; substrate-b doesn't claim to replace it.

The honest framing: substrate-b collapses Historisation + TSDB into one primitive (Lance versions) and **shares storage with non-regulatory audit when retention is configured**, but does not displace a regulatory-grade audit sink. Treat regulatory audit as orthogonal.

### 5.2 ACL changes take effect immediately, by construction

Because the per-element auth check is a bit-op against the per-vertex bitmap (no separate cache), an ACL change at Lance version V is in effect at every read at version >= V. There is no auth-cache invalidation step; substrate-b consumers should NOT introduce one. The materialisation of `_effectiveReaders` on write is the only side-effect.

### 5.3 The actor's state history is the Lance version log

A ractor Actor following the Rubicon pattern (§2.3) does NOT need a separate state-machine event store. The Lance version log on the actor's dataset IS the state history. Substrate-b consumers should NOT introduce a side-table of state transitions; queries against the version log answer "what state was this actor in at version V?" via `checkout_version(V)`.

### 5.4 In-process events use std::sync, not tokio

The `LanceVersionWatcher` (lance-graph-callcenter) uses `std::sync::{Arc, RwLock, Mutex, Condvar, AtomicUsize}` and never `tokio::sync` — per the I-2 invariant documented in that module. Substrate-b consumers wiring real-time event subscription must follow the same rule for in-process listeners; tokio is reserved for Layer-3 outbound sinks (PhoenixServer, PostgRestHandler, WebSocket push, gRPC remote actor transport).

This is a `hollow-wire-failure-modes.md` failure-mode magnet: a consumer that introduces tokio for in-process subscription violates I-2 and creates the exact bug `version_watcher.rs`'s migration history note (2026-05-06) records as already-corrected upstream.

## 6. The OGAR carrier — substrate-b's data-model entry point

OGAR (`AdaWorldAPI/OGAR`) is the substrate-b carrier for class identity + schema + Active-Record semantics → `lance-graph-ontology::OntologyRegistry`. Substrate-b consumers feeding domain models into lance-graph go through OGAR's `MappingProposal` shape (PR `AdaWorldAPI/OGAR#5` shipped via owned-mirror workaround; Sprint 6 registry integration shipped; Sprint 7 ClassActor + KanbanMailbox muscle-memory documented and gated on the upstream symbol-layout decisions).

Consumer integration sequence (when wiring a new domain model):

1. Author the domain model as an OGAR `Class` (the IR; OGAR Sprint 1 vocab + Sprint 4.5 SurrealQL adapter shipping)
2. Feed `MappingProposal` into `OntologyRegistry` (OGAR Sprint 5/6 path)
3. The lance-graph-planner picks up the registered class for strategy dispatch
4. The `lance-graph-callcenter::LanceMembrane` (sole writer per session) projects domain events into Arrow-scalar `CognitiveEventRow` (BBB invariant: no VSA / RoleKey / NarsTruth crosses the membrane)
5. `LanceVersionWatcher` fans out to in-proc subscribers; the bus is the version pointer

No new contracts are needed for steps 1-5; the existing OGAR + lance-graph-ontology + lance-graph-callcenter surfaces compose. See `OGAR_ELIXIR_HIRO_MUSCLE_MEMORY.md` and `STANDING_WAVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §1.6 in substrate-b consumer repos for the muscle memory.

## 7. Process rule for substrate-b consumers

Before proposing a new lance-graph integration trait / contract / coordination surface:

1. Check the §3 capability roadmap — does an existing built-or-partial primitive serve the capability?
2. Check `.claude/knowledge/encoding-ecosystem.md` — does an existing codec serve the data shape?
3. Check `.claude/knowledge/lab-vs-canonical-surface.md` — is the canonical bridge the right place (vs the LAB transport)?
4. Check `.claude/knowledge/hollow-wire-failure-modes.md` — am I about to wire the lab surface without plugging the canonical bridge?

If steps 1-4 don't dissolve the proposal, then a new structure is warranted. Otherwise, the existing surfaces already name what to wire against.
