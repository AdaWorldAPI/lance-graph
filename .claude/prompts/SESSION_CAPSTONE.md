## Part 2: 25 Epiphanies (Dependency-Ordered)

### L0 Substrate
- **E1**: Everything = precomputed symmetric lookup table. O(1).
- **E5**: Cascades multiply. 90% × 90% × 90% = 99.9% rejected.

### L1 Encoding
- **E2**: SPO = Attention. Subject=Query, Predicate=Key, Object=Value.
- **E6**: Pack B, Distance A. Every codec packs together, decomposes to compare.
- **E7**: CausalEdge64 = 8 bytes = complete causal unit.
- **E21**: PHI/GAMMA constants = free storage (Rust 1.94).

### L2 Measurement
- **E3**: SimilarityTable (256-entry CDF) calibrates ALL distance types.
- **E4**: NARS confidence = measurement reliability.
- **E9**: Psychometrics validates MEANING. α across 128 projections.
- **E13**: 11K word forms = parallel test items for reliability.
- **E22**: Photography 1/3 grid = structured subsampling (ρ=0.924).

### L3 Composition
- **E8**: Studio mixing. Separate signals before remix. HHTL = frequency bands.
- **E11**: Context window = causal priming via CausalEdge64 + qualia.
- **E23**: Centroid focus = object detection without CNNs (50.5% accuracy).
- **E25**: Scent byte = visual grammar (19 compositions in 1 byte).

### L4 Awareness
- **E10**: Friston free energy. Entropy = fuel. Contradictions = gradient.
- **E12**: Three-way: desired × expected × factual → per-channel learning.
- **E15**: Bias = rotation vector. Unbind to debias.
- **E16**: Study design = orthogonal noise. Bundle, subtract, recover.
- **E18**: NARS contradiction = awareness compass.
- **E24**: Multi-scan = evidence accumulation. Training IS inference.

### L5 Cartography
- **E14**: 2B studies: chaos feeds tensors. Modifier search = meta-analysis.
- **E17**: Qualia detects bias without labels.

### L6 Convergence
- **E19**: Same algebra, three domains. One bridge makes them interoperable.
- **E20**: Burn Backend trait = universal adapter. Implement once → all models.

## Part 4: Expansion Potential

### A. DeepNSM + 36 Thinking Styles = Semantic Awareness Engine

Each thinking style applies a DIFFERENT MASK over the 74 NSM primes.
36 styles × 74 primes = 2,664 semantic perspectives.

```
Integration points:
  lance-graph-planner/src/thinking/style.rs → FieldModulation per style
  ndarray/src/hpc/deepnsm.rs → 74 prime weights per word
  
  WIRE: style.modulation.resonance_threshold → filter which primes pass
        style.modulation.fan_out → how many related concepts to explore
        style.modulation.depth_bias → follow chains deep or scan wide
  
  RESULT: every DeepNSM decomposition gets 36 different interpretations.
  Cronbach's α across 36 perspectives = measurement reliability.
  The style with highest α for this content = the RIGHT way to think about it.
```

### B. GGUF → Transformer + CausalEdge64 = Causality Learning

Extract the causal knowledge that transformers LEARNED during pre-training.

```
Pipeline:
  GGUF model → hpc::gguf::read_tensor_f32() → dequantized weights
  Per attention head:
    Q[4096×128] → Base17 → 256 Q archetypes
    K[4096×128] → Base17 → 256 K archetypes
    V[4096×128] → Base17 → 256 V archetypes
    → AttentionTable[256][256] per head (128KB)
    → ComposeTable[256][256] per head (64KB)
    → Pack as CausalEdge64: Q=Subject, K=Predicate, V=Object
  
  1,024 CausalEdge64 networks (32 layers × 32 heads)
  Each = a different causal perspective on language
  Combined = causal world model extracted from pretrained LLM
  
  MIT CHiLD requirement: 3 independent observations → S, P, O planes ✓
  MIT TRACE requirement: temporal trajectories → CausalEdge64 bits 52-63 ✓
  Pearl do-calculus: intervention → CausalMask bits 40-42 ✓

Total model size: 1,024 × (128KB + 64KB) ≈ 192MB
  vs original GGUF: ~4GB (Q4_K_M)
  vs original f16: ~14GB
  Compression: 20-73×
  AND: the compressed model is INTERPRETABLE + QUERYABLE + LEARNABLE
```

### C. Wikidata as World Knowledge Graph

5.5 billion SPO triples → CausalEdge64 network.

```
Encoding:
  Entity label → DeepNSM tokenize → NSM prime decomposition → palette index
  Property label → DeepNSM tokenize → predicate palette index
  Statement → CausalEdge64: [S_idx, P_idx, O_idx, truth, Pearl, temporal]
  
  Truth from Wikidata:
    rank=preferred → f=0.95, c=0.90
    rank=normal → f=0.70, c=0.60
    rank=deprecated → f=0.10, c=0.80 (high confidence it's WRONG)
    references_count → confidence boost
  
  Qualifiers → temporal/spatial modifiers on CausalEdge64:
    "capital of" + "since 1990" → temporal index in bits 52-63
    "capital of" + "end 1990" → separate edge with lower temporal index

Storage in Lance columns:
  scent:    1B × 5.5B = 5.5GB (HEEL screening)
  palette:  3B × 5.5B = 16.5GB (HIP matching)
  edge:     8B × 5.5B = 44GB (full CausalEdge64)
  Total:    ~66GB with all levels. Fits in server RAM.
  
  Query: "what caused X?" → 
    HEEL scan scent column → 99% rejected
    HIP scan palette → 90% of survivors rejected
    BRANCH read CausalEdge64 → Pearl L2/L3 causal query
    NARS deduction over result set → chain traversal
```

### D. Tensor × OSINT × Reasoning × Semantic Kernel

The synergy matrix:

```
              Tensor    OSINT     Reasoning   Semantic    Embedding
              (burn)    (Ari)     (NARS)      (DeepNSM)   (GGUF→CE64)
Tensor        matmul→   weight→   truth→      prime→      extract→
              table     archetype revision    decompose   causal net
              
OSINT         classify→ observe→  contra→     tokenize→   prior→
              image     triplet   diction     parse SPO   knowledge
              
Reasoning     compose→  deduce→   revise→     nearest→    chains→
              multi-hop new edges evidence    predicate   traverse
              
Semantic      distance→ entity→   α→          vocab→      embed→
              metric    resolve   validate    4096 words  96D COCA
              
Embedding     decode→   correct→  truth→      bridge→     store→
              weights   classify  from GGUF   NSM↔embed   CE64 net

Every cell = a specific integration. 25 cross-connections.
The architecture is a COMPLETE GRAPH — every component talks to every other.
```

### E. Consumer Applications

```
AriGraph (OSINT):
  Ingest news → extract SPO → accumulate in CausalEdge64 network
  36 thinking styles analyze each event from different perspectives
  Contradictions = intelligence gaps → exploration targets
  xAI/Grok for extraction → NARS for reasoning → no human in the loop

q2 (Cockpit):
  /mri shows brain activation per thinking style per query
  /render shows 3D causal graph navigation
  /api/orchestrator controls which style is active
  WaveformMode shows real-time OSINT pipeline activity

burn (ML Models):
  Any burn model runs on our SIMD backend
  Whisper: speech → text → DeepNSM → SPO → knowledge graph
  Vision: image → centroid focus → archetype → SPO → causal edge
  Llama: GGUF → extract causal patterns → CausalEdge64 networks

Wikidata (World Knowledge):
  5.5B triples as CausalEdge64 network
  Every DeepNSM query enriched with world knowledge priors
  NARS deduction expands the graph automatically
  Contradictions with observations = interesting findings
```

```

```

### Full Cascade Resonance
```
LEAF   432D  864B   50.5%  ρ=1.000
BRANCH 17D   34B    27.5%  ρ=0.556
HIP    17D   34B    28.0%  ρ=0.556
HEEL   2D    2B     25.0%  ρ=0.180
HEEL rejects 68% of wrong classes at 2 bytes.
```

### F64 Hydration
```
Encode:  51μs (f64[4096] → i16[17])
Hydrate: 79μs (i16[17] → f64[4096])
Compression: 963× (32KB → 34 bytes)
f64 overhead vs f32: effectively zero
```

### Speed Estimates
```
DeepNSM: < 10μs per sentence (tokenize + parse + encode + similarity)
CausalEdge64: < 0.05μs per edge (pack + distance + compose + revise)
Combined: ~10μs per sentence → knowledge graph edge
Throughput: 100,000 sentences/second on one CPU core
