## 0 — Why this exists (the anti-synthesis-spiral guard)

Two Opus mapping passes (AGENT_LOG 2026-06-20) established the qualitative truth:
the substrate has **all the pieces** of a phase-aligned, per-SoA-owned, version-arc-
scheduled cognitive loop (`kanban` Rubicon phases, `MailboxSoaOwner`/`View` split,
`VersionScheduler`/`NextPhaseScheduler`, `CycleAccumulator`, the `Meta`/`Qualia`/
`Plasticity` tenants, `mul.rs` DK/Trust/Flow/Gate, `OrchestrationBridge`/`BridgeSlot`,
surrealdb `timeline.rs`), **but the runtime loop is not closed** — `UnifiedStep`
carries no SoA pointer, the batch writer pushes nothing, the timeline is unwired
(`#[allow(dead_code)]`), kanban is not yet a value tenant, and no pipelining exists.

The risk this plan removes: shipping the kanban tenant + calling the loop "done"
by assertion. Instead we **measure** the three quantities below and drive run-NaN
toward 0 seam by seam.

## 1 — The three measured quantities (the dashboard)

| Metric | Definition | How measured | Baseline (Wave 0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Piece-presence %** | of the N named loop components, how many TYPES exist | static: grep the contract + surrealdb for each named type | **100% — 15/15 measured 2026-06-21** (all named loop types/fns present in the contract; `BridgeSlot` is a `trait`) |
| **Seam-wiring %** | of the M seams (S1..S7), how many are CONNECTED (caller→callee actually invoked in a non-test path) | runtime-trace: instrument one cycle, count seams that fire | **~57% static — 4/7 measured 2026-06-21** (S1/S2/S3/S4 have non-test consumers; S5/S6/S7 gaps). Static = a non-test call site exists, NOT that it fires NaN-free at runtime. Advanced past the plan's "S4 deferred" — consumers arrived. |
| **Run-NaN %** | of the K observable outputs in one end-to-end cycle, fraction that are NaN / `None` / unhandled-`BridgeSlot` / default-fallback | run one cycle on shipped code, count valid vs NaN | **HYPOTHESIS** — needs one runtime cycle; `symbiont::kanban_loop::run_to_absorbing` is now a runnable end-to-end harness, so this is measurable when build/disk allows (deferred this pass — disk ceiling) |

**These are distinct.** A piece can be present (99%) yet its seam unwired (28% gap)
yet its output NaN at runtime (72%). The plan's success metric is **run-NaN → <5%**
with **seam-wiring → 100%**, each step backed by a probe number.

## 2 — The loop under test (one cycle)

```text
SoA node (Kanban tenant: phase)                         ── S1
  → MUL reads Qualia(flow/trust/DK)+Meta(NARS/FE)+Plasticity ── S2
  → GateDecision (flow vs mismatch)                     ── S2
  → owner advances Kanban phase (gated write)           ── S1/S2
  → VersionScheduler lowers version-arc → KanbanMove    ── S3
  → UnifiedStep routed via BridgeSlot (lance/surreal/lancedb) ── S4
  → batch writer commits → Lance version (push?)        ── S5
  → timeline view renders kanbanview (zero-copy?)       ── S6
  → SoA self-NaN-census written to Meta (meta-awareness)── S7
  → (next cycle, pipelined against this one's disk-push)── S5/G2
```

## 3 — The seams (each a probe with PASS / KILL)

| Seam | Claim | Probe (pass/fail) | KILL condition | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** kanban tenant | `ValueTenant::Kanban` at `row_offset 144` (`[112,120)` in the value slab) carries phase+cycle+exec, layout-preserving | field-isolation matrix: write each tenant, assert all others unchanged; `NodeRowPacket` round-trips kanban byte-exact | stride ≠ 512, or any other tenant perturbed | ✅ **FINDING (green 2026-06-20)** — shipped `ValueTenant::Kanban`/`KanbanTenant`/`NodeRow::{kanban,set_kanban}`; field-isolation + schema-membership tests pass; Full 112→120 ≤ 480, stride 512. + `tenant_counter` instrument. |
| **S2** MUL→phase | `MUL::GateDecision(Qualia,Meta,Plasticity)` mismatch ⇒ owner advances phase | feed a known flow-vs-mismatch qualia vector; assert the gate returns the expected `KanbanMove` (or HOLD) | gate ignores qualia (constant output), or reads uninitialized → NaN | ✅ **FINDING (green 2026-06-21)** — `NodeRow::{qualia,mul_phase_step}` + `KanbanColumn::advance_on_gate` wire `gate_decision_i4(node.qualia(), mantissa)` → DAG-legal phase advance (Flow→forward, Block→Prune-where-legal, Hold→None). Probe `s2_mul_phase_step_*` asserts all three on known qualia vectors. Pure read (owner applies via `set_kanban`). Uses the i4 integer gate — no f64/NaN path. |
| **S3** version→move | `VersionScheduler::on_version` lowers a real Lance version to the next legal `KanbanMove` | drive a 2-version dataset; assert the forward-arc move emitted | no move on a legal transition, or illegal edge emitted | ✅ **FINDING (lowering green — already shipped)** — `scheduler.rs::NextPhaseScheduler::on_version` + 6 tests (`scheduled_move_is_a_legal_rubicon_edge`, forward-arc Planning→CW→Eval→Commit, `absorbing_columns_schedule_nothing`, Libet anchor, exec-thread). Grade corrected from CONJECTURE: the *version→move lowering* is proven. **Remaining gap = the live subscription** (a `LanceVersionScheduler` subscribing to `Dataset::versions()` via the callcenter `LanceVersionWatcher` — downstream crate, not the contract). |
| **S4** envelope route | a kanban `UnifiedStep` reaches the present `BridgeSlot` (surreal plan engaged by Cargo presence) | register a surreal slot; route a `step_type:"kanban.*"`; assert it lands; with slot absent assert graceful unhandled (not panic) | routes to wrong domain, or panics when slot absent | **DESIGN-LOCKED B / DEFERRED (5+3 council 2026-06-21)** — `UnifiedStep` stays **pointer-free**; typed identity rides the `KanbanMove` sidecar (`mailbox: MailboxId` + `cycle()`), the node self-describes phase via `ValueTenant::Kanban` (G1 subsumed). **A/C rejected** (council 6×B): adding a field breaks all 7 `UnifiedStep` struct-literal sites + forces a crewai-rust/n8n-rs multi-repo bump (no `#[non_exhaustive]`/Default), AND duplicates identity the node already owns (lab-vs-canonical "extend by column, not layer" + R1/zero-copy). Routing is `step_type:"kanban.*"` → `StepDomain::from_step_type` → `Kanban`; absent domain → graceful `OrchestrationError::DomainUnavailable` (proven shape, `orchestration.rs:392/409`). **DEFERRED** (overclaim+truth-architect): the real route consumer is downstream scaffold (no surreal `BridgeSlot` registered, no `Kanban` arm in `PlannerAwareness::route`, no `impl OrchestrationBridge` in the contract) — building the field/probe now would be "scaffold dressed as a seam." S4 lifts when a downstream bridge routes `kanban.*` to a registered slot. **Update 2026-06-21:** crewai-rust + n8n-rs EVICTED (operator) → the multi-repo-bump objection to option A is now VOID; A would be an **in-tree-only** change (7 struct-literal sites) if ever needed. Decision UNCHANGED (B): the load-bearing reasons stand — the node's kanban tenant already owns the identity (A duplicates it), and no route consumer exists (defer). Prefer B unless a future consumer is *measured* unable to resolve identity from the node. |
| **S5** batch push | commit PUSHES a kanban update to the planner (not pull-only) | commit a row; assert a push/notify carrying the `KanbanMove` is observed | commit only notifies the optimizer (current state) → gap stays | GAP (measured: pull-only) |
| **S6** timeline view | `TimelineView` renders the kanbanview **zero-copy** (`FixedSizeBinary(512)` → `&[NodeRow]`) | store a node as `FixedSizeBinary(512)`; `node_rows_from_le_bytes` over the column buffer; assert ptr-identity (no copy) | `val` is variable `Binary` (current) → cannot zero-copy | **MANDATED DIRECTION — operator override 2026-06-21 (corrects the earlier 5+3 council framing).** Three operator NOs supersede the council's suggestions: (1) **NO second copy / second column** — the rejected `soa_val`-alongside-`val` (soa-review C) and the owned-`Vec<NodeRow>` (A) are OUT; the SoA is stored **ONCE** as `FixedSizeBinary(512)` and read zero-copy `&[NodeRow]` via `node_rows_from_le_bytes`. The single SoA home is **lance-graph's own Lance dataset**; surrealdb is the Rubicon **VIEW** over it (never a second store) — so there is no duplicate column and no opacity violation. (2) **NO dropping time-series via tombstone+purge** — the Lance version history IS the Rubicon timeline; tombstones mark logical deletion *at a version* but `cleanup_old_versions`/purge must NOT drop history; `Timeline::view_at(v)` stays queryable across the arc. (3) **lance 7.0.0 is MANDATORY, not "unverified"** — pinned in both repos' `Cargo.lock` (surrealdb 6→7 contradiction fixed + committed); any lance-6→7 API drift gets fixed on the fly, never a deferral gate. The earlier "consumer-side per-cell-with-copy-fallback floor / separate column deferred behind an unverified baseline" framing is RETRACTED. See `E-S6-SOA-IS-ONE-FIXEDSIZEBINARY-NO-SECOND-COPY`. |
| **S7** meta-awareness | the SoA carries its OWN wiring-completeness census in the `Meta` tenant | compute the run-NaN% of one cycle; write it as a free-energy/awareness field; assert it reads back and reflects the real gap count | census not written, or hard-coded (doesn't track real gaps) | CONJECTURE (the capstone itself) |

## 4 — Waves (probe-ordered; no brick lands before its probe is green)

- **Wave 0 — measure the baseline on SHIPPED code (no new code).** Instrument one
  end-to-end cycle against `main` as it stands; produce the first real
  `(piece-presence%, seam-wiring%, run-NaN%)` triple. **This is the honest
  number behind "99/28/72."** Output: a `nan_census` example/bench + a recorded
  baseline. Until this runs, "72% NaN" stays a HYPOTHESIS in this doc.
- **Wave 1 — S1 + S2** (the kanban tenant keystone + the MUL trigger). Build the
  8-byte tenant (gated on operator go), field-isolation test (S1 green), wire the
  MUL→phase function (S2 green). Re-measure the triple; expect run-NaN to drop.
- **Wave 2 — S4 + S5 + S6** (envelope routing, batch push, `FixedSizeBinary(512)`).
  The heavier surrealdb-side + contract envelope work. Each gated on its probe.
  **Status (2026-06-21, operator override):** S4 design-locked B/deferred. **S6 mandated
  direction:** the SoA is stored ONCE as `FixedSizeBinary(512)` in lance-graph's own
  Lance dataset and read zero-copy `&[NodeRow]`; surrealdb is the Rubicon VIEW over it.
  **NO second copy / second column** (the earlier `soa_val`-alongside-`val` + owned-`Vec`
  suggestions are RETRACTED). **NO time-series drop** via tombstone+purge — version
  history is the timeline. **lance 7.0.0 is MANDATORY** (pinned in both `Cargo.lock`s;
  surrealdb 6→7 fixed) — not a deferral gate; drift fixed on the fly. S5 (batch push)
  remains GAP.
- **Wave 3 — S7** the meta-awareness self-census: the SoA writes its own run-NaN%
  into `Meta`. The capstone — the system measuring its own wiring.

## 4.1 — Wave 0 MEASURED (static census, 2026-06-21)

First real census, run statically over the workspace (read/grep, no build — disk
ceiling deferred the runtime half). **Static ≠ runtime:** "wired" below means a
non-test call site exists in a runtime path, NOT that the seam fires NaN-free.

**Piece-presence: 100% (15/15).** Every named loop component resolves in the
contract: `ValueTenant`/`KanbanTenant`/`mul_phase_step`/`gate_decision_i4`/
`advance_on_gate`/`VersionScheduler`/`on_version`/`UnifiedStep`/`BridgeSlot`
(trait)/`OrchestrationBridge`/`from_step_type`/`node_rows_from_le_bytes`/
`MailboxSoaOwner`/`try_advance_phase`/`CycleAccumulator`.

**Seam-wiring: 4/7 (~57%) have a non-test consumer.** Evidence (file:line):

| Seam | Static wiring | Non-test consumer |
|---|---|---|
| S1 owner write | ✅ WIRED | `symbiont/src/kanban_loop.rs:120` + `cognitive-shader-driver/src/mailbox_soa.rs:1066` call `try_advance_phase` |
| S2 MUL gate | ✅ WIRED (gate) | `sigma-tier-router/src/lib.rs:365` calls `gate_decision_i4`. **Nuance:** the consumed path is `gate_decision_i4` directly; the `NodeRow::mul_phase_step` wrapper is **test-only** (no runtime caller) — the node-method seam is unused, the gate it wraps is used. |
| S3 version→move | ✅ WIRED | `symbiont/src/kanban_loop.rs:116` `sched.on_version(...)` inside `fn step()` — the live subscription the plan called "the remaining gap (downstream crate)" now EXISTS (synchronous writer-fired). |
| S4 envelope route | ✅ WIRED (skeleton) | `StepDomain::Kanban` exists (`orchestration.rs:55`), `from_step_type("kanban")→Kanban` (`:79`); real bridge impls call it — `lance-graph-planner/src/orchestration_impl.rs:48`, `cognitive-shader-driver/src/codec_bridge.rs:32`. **Domain resolves; end-to-end dispatch-to-handler for `kanban.*` unverified** (the deeper S4 probe). The plan's "no route consumer exists / defer" premise is now FALSE. |
| S5 batch push | ❌ GAP | surrealdb-side (out of this repo); plan records pull-only. |
| S6 zero-copy read | ❌ GAP (in-repo) | `node_rows_from_le_bytes` has **only test callers** in lance-graph; the runtime consumer is surrealdb (separate repo). |
| S7 meta census | ❌ CONJECTURE | not built. |

**Corrections to the plan's narrative (stale → measured):**
- **S3** — upgrade "live subscription pending (downstream)" → **wired in `symbiont::kanban_loop`** (the OUT leg `tick → on_version → try_advance_phase`, with `domino_sweep` on the `CognitiveWork` crossing).
- **S4** — the DESIGN-LOCKED-B/DEFERRED rationale ("no `impl OrchestrationBridge`, no `Kanban` arm, no route consumer") is **superseded by code**: the impls + the `Kanban` domain now exist (consumers migrating to UnifiedBridge). Decision **B still holds** (`UnifiedStep` stays pointer-free; identity rides the `KanbanMove` sidecar) — what changed is the deferral gate lifted, so the *real* S4 probe (does a `kanban.*` step dispatch to a registered handler end-to-end?) is now runnable, not blocked.

**Run-NaN: still HYPOTHESIS.** The runtime half needs one end-to-end cycle. `symbiont::kanban_loop::run_to_absorbing(&NextPhaseScheduler)` is now a self-contained harness for exactly that — instrument it, count valid-vs-NaN/`None` outputs per cycle. Deferred this pass only because the `symbiont` build exceeds the current disk ceiling; it is no longer architecturally blocked (a harness exists), only resource-blocked.

## 5 — The honest AGI-adjacency framing (overclaim guard)

What the green end-state proves: **the substrate can close an active-inference
loop over the SoA, per-SoA-owned, NaN-free, with the system carrying a census of
its own remaining gaps.** That is *adjacency* — the structure of the thing — not a
claim of AGI. The load-bearing word is **IF**: IF all seams go green AND run-NaN→0
AND S7 self-census tracks real gaps, THEN we are at aspiration-adjacency. The plan
converts the IF into a measured fact; it never asserts the THEN. (truth-architect /
overclaim-auditor: AGI-adjacency is the hypothesis the census tests, not a headline.)

The genuinely novel measurable: **S7 — a system aware of what it cannot yet do**
(the φ-1 permanent-humility ceiling, made a number in the `Meta` tenant). That
self-NaN-census is the "Orchestration meta-awareness plan" the operator named.
