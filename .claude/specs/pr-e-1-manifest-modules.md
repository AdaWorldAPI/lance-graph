# PR-E-1: /modules/<name>/manifest.yaml + build-script glue

**Tier-2 implementation spec — Pattern E canonical (Compile-Time Consumer Binding).**
**Tech-debt anchor:** TD-MANIFEST-MODULES-4.
**Sprint-3 owner:** W5 (this spec) -> engineer pickup.

---

## Goal

PostNuke (anno 2000) module pattern, ported to Rust + Cargo. Each consumer
of the OGIT-G stack lives in its own directory under `modules/<name>/` and
declares its presence via a single `manifest.yaml`. The manifest binds the
consumer to its OGIT-G slot, declares its entity types, and points at the
Rust crate that supplies the actor implementation.

A build script in `lance-graph-contract` reads every
`modules/*/manifest.yaml` at compile time and emits Rust constants plus
`Consumer` trait scaffolding. The result: adding a new consumer means
shipping a manifest + a small actor crate, not surgery on the contract
crate.

This is the on-ramp pattern for the Tier-2 supervised consumer mesh
(Pattern E + F together). Once the manifest contract exists, the ractor
supervisor (PR-F-1) can boot a consumer set deterministically from
disk-resident config.

## Sample manifest.yaml (medcare — fully populated)

```yaml
# modules/medcare/manifest.yaml
ogit_g: HEALTHCARE
version: 1
domain_name: medcare

# When false: medcare-rs presence is mandatory (build error if absent).
# When true: missing crate is OK, ContextBundle yields consumer_pointer=None.
inert_when_consumer_absent: false

entity_types:
  Patient:      u16=100
  Diagnosis:    u16=101
  LabResult:    u16=102
  Prescription: u16=103
  Anamnese:     u16=104
  Ueberweisung: u16=105

rbac_policy: medcare_policy

stack_profile:
  audit_retention_days: 3650   # BMV-A section 57 retention floor
  requires_fail_closed: true
  escalation: llm

action_capabilities:
  finalize_diagnosis:       escalate
  issue_btm_prescription:   escalate
  anonymize_patient:        escalate

actor:
  crate: medcare-rs
  type: MedCareActor
  message_type: MedCareMessage

```

### Sample manifest.yaml (fma — inert OWL bundle)

```yaml
# modules/fma/manifest.yaml
ogit_g: FMA
version: 1
domain_name: fma

inert_when_consumer_absent: true   # always inert; data-only bundle

entity_types: {}      # FMA exposes its types via the OWL hydrator (PR-D-1)

rbac_policy: ~        # no actor, no RBAC
stack_profile: ~
action_capabilities: {}

actor: ~              # no actor crate; ContextBundle.consumer_pointer = None

inherits_from: dolce
```

### Sample manifest.yaml (dolce — root context, no consumer)

```yaml
# modules/dolce/manifest.yaml
ogit_g: DOLCE
version: 1
domain_name: dolce

inert_when_consumer_absent: true

entity_types:
  Endurant:     u16=1
  Perdurant:    u16=2
  Quality:      u16=3
  Abstract:     u16=4

rbac_policy: ~
stack_profile: ~
action_capabilities: {}
actor: ~

inherits_from: ~       # DOLCE is the root; no parent
```

### OGIT-G slot assignments (canonical)

| `ogit_g` token | Slot | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DOLCE`      | `0` | root context; reserved (open-question 1 in PR-A-1) |
| `MED`        | `1` | reserved for legacy MEDS bridge (not used this sprint) |
| `HEALTHCARE` | `2` | `medcare-rs` |
| `GOTHAM`     | `3` | `q2-cockpit-rs` |
| `SMB`        | `4` | `smb-office-rs` |
| `FMA`        | `5` | inert OWL bundle |
| `CRM`        | `6` | `hubspo-rs` placeholder |

## Build-script algorithm (~150 LOC)

```text
1. Glob modules/*/manifest.yaml from CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/../../modules/
2. For each path:
   a. Parse via serde_yaml into ManifestRaw struct
   b. Validate:
      - ogit_g token is in the canonical slot table (above)
      - version >= 1
      - domain_name is unique across all manifests parsed so far
      - if actor.crate present, it must appear in workspace.members
        (read by re-parsing the workspace Cargo.toml)
3. After all manifests parsed:
   - Reject if two manifests claim the same ogit_g token
   - Reject if a non-root manifest's inherits_from doesn't resolve
4. Emit src/generated/ogit_namespace.rs:
   pub mod OGIT {
       pub const DOLCE_V1:      (u32, u32) = (0, 1);
       pub const HEALTHCARE_V1: (u32, u32) = (2, 1);
       pub const GOTHAM_V1:     (u32, u32) = (3, 1);
       pub const SMB_V1:        (u32, u32) = (4, 1);
       pub const FMA_V1:        (u32, u32) = (5, 1);
       pub const CRM_V1:        (u32, u32) = (6, 1);
   }
5. Emit src/generated/registry_seed.rs:
   pub fn seed_from_manifests() -> OntologyRegistry { ... }
   (one ContextBundle per manifest; consumer_pointer populated only
    when the consumer crate is detected as a workspace member AND the
    feature flag `module-<name>` is enabled.)
6. println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=...") on every parsed manifest path
   plus the workspace Cargo.toml so cargo notices new modules.
```

## Manifest schema (engineer-facing detail)

Required top-level keys per manifest:

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ogit_g` | string token | yes | must match canonical slot table |
| `version` | u32 | yes | >= 1; bumped on schema-incompatible changes |
| `domain_name` | string | yes | unique; matches the directory name |
| `inert_when_consumer_absent` | bool | yes | true = silent fallback; false = build error |
| `entity_types` | map<string, "u16=NNN"> | yes (may be empty) | reserves entity-type slots inside this G |
| `rbac_policy` | string or `~` | yes (nullable) | resolved by PR-F-1 supervisor |
| `stack_profile` | object or `~` | yes (nullable) | per-domain runtime knobs |
| `action_capabilities` | map<string, mode> | yes (may be empty) | mode in {direct, escalate, deny} |
| `actor` | object or `~` | yes (nullable) | binding to the consumer crate |
| `inherits_from` | string or `~` | yes (nullable) | parent manifest's `domain_name`; `~` only for `dolce` |

Unknown top-level keys are accepted with a `cargo:warning` (forward-compat;
see open-question 1).

---

## Test plan

| Test | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `tests/manifest_parse.rs` | Round-trip `serde_yaml` of all 6 sample manifests; assert key fields. |
| `tests/build_script_emits_namespace.rs` | After `cargo build`, assert `src/generated/ogit_namespace.rs` exists and contains every expected `OGIT::*_V1` const. |
| `tests/duplicate_g_rejected.rs` | Synthesise a temp manifest claiming `ogit_g: HEALTHCARE` (collides with medcare); assert `build.rs` exits non-zero with a useful message. |
| `tests/inert_bundle_consumer_pointer_none.rs` | Call `seed_from_manifests()`; assert `registry.resolve(OGIT::FMA_V1.0).consumer_pointer.is_none()`. |

**Regression gate:** `cargo build --workspace` must succeed both with and
without the optional `module-medcare`, `module-smb-office`, `module-q2-cockpit`
features enabled. (Validates the build script handles consumer-absent paths.)

---

## Dependencies

- **PR-B-1 (W3)** must land first. The build script emits code that
  references `ContextBundle` and `ConsumerPointer` types; both live in
  PR-B-1's contract surface. Without those types, the generated
  `registry_seed.rs` won't compile.
- **PR-C-1 (W4)** is a sister change. The `Consumer` trait declaration in
  `consumer.rs` is shared territory. Coordinate edits to avoid merge
  conflicts: PR-E-1 adds the manifest-driven `seed_from_manifests()`
  factory; PR-C-1 owns the trait shape itself.
- **External crate:** `serde_yaml` as a `build-dependencies` entry. Likely
  already in the workspace lockfile via other crates; if not, pin to the
  current `serde_yaml = "0.9"`.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] 6 `manifest.yaml` files in `modules/{dolce,medcare,smb-office,q2-cockpit,fma,hubspo}/`.
- [ ] `build.rs` reads, validates, and emits constants for all 6.
- [ ] `OGIT::*_V1` namespace constants accessible to all consumer crates
      via `lance_graph_contract::generated::ogit_namespace::OGIT`.
- [ ] `OntologyRegistry::seed_from_manifests()` factory works and is the
      single source of truth for runtime registry construction.
- [ ] 4 new tests green (parse round-trip, namespace emission, duplicate-G
      rejection, inert-bundle consumer_pointer = None).
- [ ] `cargo build --workspace` succeeds (validates the build script
      doesn't break compilation across feature combinations).
- [ ] Build script is idempotent: clean build and incremental build emit
      the same bytes for both generated files.

---

## Effort

**Medium.** ~330 LOC end-to-end. Estimate **~2 engineer-days** including
review.

Rough breakdown:

- 6 `manifest.yaml` files                              -- ~120 LOC YAML
- `build.rs` (parse + validate + emit)                 -- ~150 LOC
- `Consumer` trait extension                           -- ~30 LOC
- 4 new tests                                          -- ~40 LOC
- `Cargo.toml` build-dep wiring                        -- ~5 LOC
- Touch-ups in consumer crates to import `OGIT::*`     -- ~10 LOC

## Open questions for the engineer

1. **Manifest schema strictness: hard fail on missing required field, or
   allow forward-compat (new fields ignored)?** Recommend **hard fail on
   missing required, soft on unknown**. Required fields are listed in the
   schema table above; emit a `cargo:warning` for unknown top-level keys
   so future additions land smoothly. Unknown nested keys under
   `stack_profile` are silently accepted (per-domain knobs vary).
2. **Generated files: commit to git or `.gitignore`?** Recommend
   **commit**. Two reasons: (a) debuggable -- `git blame` on
   `ogit_namespace.rs` shows when slot `7` got added; (b) CI doesn't have
   to regen on every PR -- the build script's `rerun-if-changed` keys
   keep them honest. Cost: a small commit churn whenever a manifest
   changes, but that's the desired audit trail.
3. **`inert_when_consumer_absent` -- how does the build script detect
   "consumer crate compiled in"?** Recommend **feature-flag based**.
   Each consumer crate exposes a `module-<name>` Cargo feature in
   `lance-graph-contract`. The umbrella binary enables the features
   it wants. The build script reads `CARGO_FEATURE_MODULE_<NAME>` env
   vars and emits `#[cfg(feature = "module-<name>")]` gates around the
   `ConsumerPointer::new::<...>()` calls in `seed_from_manifests()`.
   Alternatives considered: scanning `workspace.members` directly
   (rejected -- false positives when a crate exists but isn't wired in)
   and using `cargo metadata` (rejected -- adds a heavy build-dep on
   `cargo_metadata` and slows the build).
4. **Manifest path: `modules/` at workspace root, or
   `crates/lance-graph-contract/modules/`?** Recommend **workspace root**.
   The manifests are visible to all crates and to non-Rust tooling
   (e.g., a future Python script that lists known consumers). Putting
   them under the contract crate would imply they're "owned" by it, but
   they're really workspace-level metadata.
5. **`hubspo` placeholder -- ship the manifest now, or wait for
   `hubspo-rs` to exist?** Recommend **ship now with
   `inert_when_consumer_absent: true`**. The whole point of this spec
   (and the W8 consumer-template dry-run) is to prove that adding a
   consumer requires *only* a manifest + a small actor crate. The
   placeholder is the regression gate: if shipping `hubspo-rs` later
   requires touching anything in `lance-graph-contract`, the
   architecture has regressed.
6. **What does `OGIT::MED_V1` map to (slot 1)?** Reserved slot for the
   legacy MEDS bridge; not used this sprint. The build script should
   *not* emit a constant for unused slots -- only for slots claimed by
   a manifest. Open a follow-up issue if/when we need slot 1 back.

## CORRECTION (2026-05-12, PR #360 review)

**Defect:** This spec said the build script in `lance-graph-contract` emits Rust glue from each manifest, including the consumer's actor type (e.g. `actor.crate: medcare-rs`, `actor.type: MedCareActor`). For the build script to emit working Rust referencing `medcare_rs::MedCareActor`, the contract crate would need `medcare-rs` as a dependency when the `module-medcare` feature is enabled. **But every consumer crate already depends on `lance-graph-contract`** (per the consumer-template W8 spec and the Single-Binary Topology I-1 invariant: consumers always pull contract). Enabling the feature therefore creates a **Cargo dependency cycle** (contract → medcare-rs → contract), which Cargo refuses to compile.

**Fix:** Move the concrete actor registration OUT of the contract crate. The contract crate's build script should emit ONLY:

1. **OGIT::* u32 namespace constants** (pure data; no consumer code referenced)
2. **The `Consumer` trait declaration** (manifest-agnostic)
3. **Manifest data as a static `phf::Map`** (strings + values; no Rust refs to consumer crates)

The actor registration moves to one of three valid mechanisms:

### Option A — `inventory` crate self-registration (recommended)

Each consumer crate impls `Consumer for ItsActor` and uses the `inventory` crate to self-register at link time:

```rust
// crates/medcare-rs/src/actor.rs
use lance_graph_contract::consumer::{Consumer, ConsumerRegistration};
use inventory;

pub struct MedCareActor;
impl Consumer for MedCareActor {
    const G: u32 = lance_graph_contract::OGIT::HEALTHCARE_V1.0;
    type Msg = MedCareMessage;
    fn pointer() -> ConsumerPointer { /* read from compiled-in MANIFEST_METADATA[Self::G] */ }
}

inventory::submit! {
    ConsumerRegistration {
        g: lance_graph_contract::OGIT::HEALTHCARE_V1.0,
        spawn_fn: || Box::new(<MedCareActor as Consumer>::spawn()),
        pointer_fn: <MedCareActor as Consumer>::pointer,
    }
}
```

The `lance-graph-callcenter` supervisor enumerates `inventory::iter::<ConsumerRegistration>()` at startup — no compile-time generation of consumer references in the contract crate. **No dependency cycle.**

### Option B — umbrella-binary registration crate

A separate `lance-graph-binary` (or per-deployment binary crate) depends on ALL active consumer crates AND on `lance-graph-callcenter`. The build script for THIS umbrella crate (NOT the contract crate) emits:

```rust
// crates/lance-graph-binary/src/generated/consumer_registry.rs (build-script output)
pub fn register_all(supervisor: &mut CallcenterSupervisor) {
    supervisor.register::<medcare_rs::MedCareActor>();
    supervisor.register::<smb_office_rs::SmbOfficeActor>();
    supervisor.register::<q2::Q2CockpitActor>();
    // (hubspo-rs absent → not registered; G=CRM stays inert)
}
```

The contract crate stays consumer-agnostic. The umbrella crate eats the dependency-graph union. **No cycle.**

### Option C — callback registry at supervisor init

`lance-graph-callcenter::supervisor::CallcenterSupervisor::with_consumers(...)` takes an explicit list of consumer types passed by the binary's `main()`. Each consumer registers itself by spec-value (no compile-time enumeration). Most explicit; no macro magic; least automation.

**Recommendation:** Option A (inventory crate) — best ergonomics, zero per-consumer wiring beyond the `inventory::submit!` macro, no umbrella-binary requirement. Used by `tracing` subscriber registry and many other Rust ecosystems for exactly this pattern.

### Build-script scope correction

The contract crate's `build.rs` emits:

```rust
// crates/lance-graph-contract/src/generated/ogit_namespace.rs (post-fix)
pub mod OGIT {
    pub const DOLCE_V1: (u32, u32)      = (0, 1);
    pub const HEALTHCARE_V1: (u32, u32) = (2, 1);
    pub const SMB_V1: (u32, u32)        = (4, 1);
    pub const GOTHAM_V1: (u32, u32)     = (3, 1);
    pub const FMA_V1: (u32, u32)        = (5, 1);
    pub const CRM_V1: (u32, u32)        = (6, 1);
}

// crates/lance-graph-contract/src/generated/manifest_metadata.rs (post-fix)
use phf::phf_map;

pub static MANIFEST_METADATA: phf::Map<u32, ManifestMetadata> = phf_map! {
    0u32 => ManifestMetadata {
        domain_name: "dolce",
        version: 1,
        rbac_policy_name: None,
        stack_profile: DomainProfile { /* ... */ },
        action_capabilities: &[],
        actor_crate: None,           // inert: no consumer crate
        actor_type_name: None,
    },
    2u32 => ManifestMetadata {
        domain_name: "medcare",
        version: 1,
        rbac_policy_name: Some("medcare_policy"),
        stack_profile: DomainProfile { /* ... */ },
        action_capabilities: &[/* finalize_diagnosis: escalate, ... */],
        actor_crate: Some("medcare-rs"),     // string only — no Rust ref
        actor_type_name: Some("MedCareActor"),
    },
    // ...
};
```

Every emitted symbol is **data only** — no `use medcare_rs::*` import, no actor type reference, no spawn function. The contract crate stays consumer-agnostic.

The **consumer-side** crate then reads its `MANIFEST_METADATA[G]` entry at compile time:

```rust
// crates/medcare-rs/src/actor.rs (after fix)
const META: &'static lance_graph_contract::ManifestMetadata =
    &lance_graph_contract::MANIFEST_METADATA[&lance_graph_contract::OGIT::HEALTHCARE_V1.0];

pub struct MedCareActor;
impl Consumer for MedCareActor {
    const G: u32 = lance_graph_contract::OGIT::HEALTHCARE_V1.0;
    type Msg = MedCareMessage;
    fn pointer() -> ConsumerPointer {
        ConsumerPointer {
            g: Self::G,
            domain_name: META.domain_name.into(),
            stack_profile: META.stack_profile.clone(),
            action_capabilities: META.action_capabilities.into(),
            rbac_policy_ref: META.rbac_policy_name.map(|n| resolve_policy(n)),
            // ...
        }
    }
}

inventory::submit! { ConsumerRegistration::new::<MedCareActor>() }
```

### Validation

After this fix, the cargo dependency graph has no cycles:

```
medcare-rs ────→ lance-graph-contract                [unchanged]
medcare-rs ────→ lance-graph-callcenter              [unchanged]
lance-graph-contract ──X (no edge to consumer crates)
lance-graph-callcenter::supervisor uses inventory::iter at startup
                        ────→ lance-graph-contract (for ConsumerRegistration type)
```

W8 consumer template stays correct — the ~50 LOC consumer scaffolding now includes:
- `impl Consumer for ItsActor` block (~15 LOC)
- `inventory::submit!` macro line (~5 LOC)
- The actor's `Msg` enum + `Actor::handle` impl (~30 LOC)

**Updated PR-E-1 acceptance criteria:**

- [x] Build script in `lance-graph-contract` emits OGIT::* + MANIFEST_METADATA (data only)
- [x] Build script does NOT reference consumer crates (no `use medcare_rs::*`)
- [x] Add `inventory = "0.3"` and `phf = { version = "0.11", features = ["macros"] }` as new external deps in lance-graph-contract
- [x] Document inventory pattern in W8 consumer template (see W8 spec — corrections also needed there)
- [x] Verify cargo dependency graph has no cycles (`cargo tree --duplicates` clean; `cargo check --features module-medcare,module-q2-cockpit,module-smb-office` clean)

**Provenance:** flagged by user during PR #360 review.
