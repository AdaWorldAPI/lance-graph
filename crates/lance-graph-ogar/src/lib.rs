//! `lance-graph-ogar` — the OGAR (Open Graph of Active Record) activation crate.
//!
//! The lance-graph-side **re-export + activation** of OGAR's full Active-Record
//! surface, the OGAR half of the clean separation (operator, 2026-06-20):
//!
//! ```text
//!   lance-graph-ontology  =  OGIT   (TTL/RDF hydration spine — the ontology SOURCE)
//!   lance-graph-ogar      =  OGAR   (Active-Record Class / ClassView / adapters)
//! ```
//!
//! # OGAR is the Active-Record Core, and it already speaks the contract
//!
//! OGAR is **not** "just a codebook" — the unit is the **`Class`** and its
//! **`ClassView`** (the active-record shape: identity, state, relations,
//! composition). The codebook `u16` is one *facet* of a `Class`'s identity.
//!
//! - [`ogar_vocab::Class`] — the calcified AR shape: canonical concept + typed
//!   attributes + family-edge `Association`s. `canonical_concept_id` == the
//!   contract [`ClassId`](lance_graph_contract::class_view::ClassId).
//! - [`ogar_class_view::OgarClassView`] — **`impl lance_graph_contract::ClassView`**:
//!   builds an `ObjectView` per promoted concept, keyed by `ClassId`, exposing the
//!   whole 32-concept AR set through the contract's runtime projection trait
//!   (`render_rows(id, mask)`).
//! - [`ogar_ontology`] — prefix conventions + NiblePath identity routing.
//! - [`ogar_adapter_surrealql`] — `emit(Class) -> SurrealQL DDL` (the DO arm);
//!   the `unmap(SurrealQL) -> Class` parser half is behind `surrealql-parser`.
//!
//! OGAR depending on `lance-graph-contract` (the **zero-dep** trait crate) is
//! *not* "needing lance-graph" — contract is the compile-time handshake (the
//! "contracts compile types, never serialize" principle). OGAR stays fully
//! **headless-capable**: a build without this crate uses the contract's zero-dep
//! [`ogar_codebook`](lance_graph_contract::ogar_codebook) mirror + the bare
//! `ClassView` trait; OGAR's own crates never depend on the lance-graph engine.
//!
//! # Auto-activation = Cargo presence (no runtime detection)
//!
//! A build graph that pulls THIS crate (the golden image via `symbiont`, or any
//! AR-aware consumer — q2, medcare, …) gets the **real** OGAR `Class`/`ClassView`/
//! codebook (including [`ogar_vocab`]'s full curator-alias normalizer, so OGAR is
//! never dumbed down) **plus** the [`parity`] guard. The guard fires at two depths
//! so it cannot be silently bypassed (codex P2, PR #564):
//! - a **compile-time length fuse** ([`parity`] `const _`) that fails ANY build
//!   (`cargo build` included) if the mirror and `ogar_vocab::class_ids::ALL` have
//!   a different concept count — the most common drift (add/remove a concept);
//! - a **runtime full-bijection** check ([`parity::assert_codebook_parity`]) for
//!   id + domain agreement, asserted by this crate's tests (the CI gate) and
//!   callable at consumer startup.
//!
//! One contract source: this crate path-deps `lance-graph-contract` (the canonical
//! in-repo copy) and a `[patch]` folds `ogar-class-view`'s transitive *git*
//! contract onto the SAME path copy, so the `OgarClassView` `impl ClassView` is for
//! the contract the guard checks (an in-repo workspace root adding this crate must
//! repeat that patch — see the manifest CONSUMER REQUIREMENT note).
//!
//! # The OGIT ↔ OGAR seam
//!
//! `lance-graph-ontology` (OGIT) hydrates classes from TTL; OGAR mints the
//! calcified canonical concepts (`class_ids::ALL`) keyed by the same `ClassId`
//! space. They meet at the codebook id == `NodeGuid.classid` low u16 — the
//! `0xDDCC` domain layout the [`parity`] guard pins. Reconciling an OGIT-hydrated
//! TTL class against an OGAR-promoted concept is a `ClassId` lookup, not a parse.
