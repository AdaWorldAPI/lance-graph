# The 34 NARS reasoning recipes — when they fire, where they wire

> **Updated:** 2026-07-19. **Source of truth:** `lance_graph_contract::recipes`
> (`RECIPES: [Recipe; 34]`) + `recipe_kernels` (the 34 `Tactic` kernels) +

## §1 The catalogue (id · code · name · tier · mechanism · bucket · SPO-2³ · checklist · substrate)

Spec source: ladybug `34_TACTICS_x_REASONING_LADDER` + Sun et al. (2025) —
spec only, never a dependency (ada-rewrite-charter D0). `reads` is the kernel's
**declared input checklist** (`Tactic::requires()` over the eight
`ThoughtField`s: sd, F=free_energy, diss, temp, conf, rung, cand=candidates,
belief=beliefs) — reliability = checklist coverage.

declare EMPTY `requires()` masks — `recipe_kernels.rs` says a real tactic
"should never" read nothing; these four demo bodies need their masks declared.*

## §2 When they fire — the three gates, in order

A recipe fires when it survives **all three** layers:

**(a) The selector** — `materialize::select_tactic(&ThoughtCtx) -> u8`.
`free_energy` (surprise) is the PRIMARY, causal axis — it alone picks the
wanted mechanism (the materialization criterion; `awareness_is_causal` is the
falsifier and it holds, measured):

| axis | bands | picks |
|------|-------|-------|
| `free_energy` | ≥0.66 leap / 0.33..0.66 inference / <0.33 routine | wanted **Mechanism**: StructuralDivergence / TruthAwareInference / ParallelIndependence (+5 on match; Infrastructure is never wanted) |
| `sd` (CollapseGate) | <0.15 FLOW / ≤0.35 HOLD / >0.35 BLOCK | wanted **Bucket**: Datapath / Control / Gate (+2 on match) |
| `rung` | ≥7 / 4..6 / <4 | wanted **Tier**: ExtremelyHard / Hard / CrossTier (+1 on match) |
| `dissonance` | ≥0.5 | +1 to every TruthAwareInference recipe (tie-weight, never an override) |

Highest score wins; ties go to the **lowest id**. Inside `materialize`, F is
recomputed each step as `0.4·(1−confidence) + 0.3·dissonance + 0.3·sd` — the
selector's F axis is independent only for standalone calls.

**(b) The kernel gate** — `Tactic::gate` (ONE default, no per-tactic
overrides, measured): **Gate-bucket** recipes (#5, 6, 8, 13, 20, 26) fire only
when the gate is NOT in FLOW (there is dispersion to act on); Control/Datapath
recipes always fire. A fired kernel folds its `delta_conf` into
`ctx.confidence`; a gated-off kernel returns `Outcome::skipped()`.

**(c) The loop** — `materialize(ctx, max_steps)`: each step recomputes F;
**rest** = gate in FLOW ∧ F < 0.2 (`HOMEOSTASIS_FLOOR`). A step that *fired*
settles the state (`sd ×= 0.85`, `dissonance ×= 0.6`,
`confidence += 0.35·(1−confidence)` — active inference: attending resolves
uncertainty), guaranteeing FLOW in ~log steps. A *blocked* step changed
nothing, so the loop halts rather than spin. "Can't NOT think while surprise
exists" is these three lines.

## §3 The measured dispatch map (54 awareness cells)

```

**Measured findings (E-RECIPE-SELECTOR-REACHABILITY-1):**

1. **8 of 34 are selector-reachable**: #1 RTE, #3 SMAD, #4 RCR, #5 TCP, #6 TR,
   #10 MCP, #17 CDI, #28 SSAM. The other 26 NEVER win `select_tactic`.
2. **All 14 Infrastructure recipes: unreachable** (mechanism match = +5, the
   max non-match score = bucket 2 + tier 1 + reconcile 1 = 4; Infrastructure is
   never the wanted mechanism).
3. **In-band shadowing by the lowest-id tie**: PI loses #2, 20, 26, 30; TAI
   loses #7, 11, 21; SD loses #9, 13, 23, **#31 ICR**, 34. Sharpest case:
   **ICR — one of only two causal-lattice-Covered recipes — is permanently
   shadowed by #4 RCR** (same band, bucket, tier; higher id). The
   counterfactual runbook can only fire via the style fan or a direct
   `kernel(31)` call.
4. **The dissonance axis is inert in dispatch** (all 27 coherent/contradicted
   cell-pairs identical): the +1 boosts all six TAI recipes uniformly in-band
   and cannot cross the +5 gap between bands. Contradiction currently changes
   *nothing* about which tactic fires — only `materialize`'s settle path decays
   it. (The #515 regression test guards that dissonance must not OVERRIDE F; no
   test guards that it does anything at all.)
5. Selector and kernel-gate are mutually consistent: Gate-bucket winners (#5,
   #6) win only in BLOCK cells, where their ≠FLOW gate is satisfied — the
   selector never dispatches a recipe that would immediately skip.

Consequence for wiring: **the surprise selector is a narrow front-door (8
recipes); the style→mechanism fan is the wide door (whole mechanism class).**
Any production escalation edge (MUL → `select_tactic`) inherits the 8-recipe
surface unless it composes the style fan — a design decision, not an accident,
to make explicitly when W-D production wiring lands.

## §4 Where they wire — today (live consumers)

| wire | file | what it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| **The engine** | `crates/lance-graph-contract/src/materialize.rs` | `select_tactic` + `kernel(id).run` in the closed F→34→F loop; `Trace` = which tactic fired and why (provenance) |
| **Shader driver (provenance)** | `crates/cognitive-shader-driver/src/driver.rs:980` | `materialize_provenance(..)` runs `materialize(&mut ctx, 64)` ALONGSIDE every dispatch cycle; the `Trace` lands in the crystal as `MaterializeProvenance` |
| **Planner / kanban (the wide door)** | `crates/lance-graph-planner/src/strategy/style_strategy.rs` | `ThinkingStyle → cluster() → Mechanism → recipes_for(style)` fans the WHOLE mechanism class through `kernel(recipe.id).run` — the only live route to the 26 selector-unreachable recipes (`ExecTarget::Elixir`, the interpreted layer) |
| **Registry** | `crates/lance-graph-contract/src/recipe_kernels.rs:916` | `kernel(id) -> Option<&'static dyn Tactic>`, `all_kernels() -> [_; 34]` — direct dispatch for anyone holding an id |
| **Kanban view updates (example-tier)** | `crates/lance-graph/examples/graph_self_reasoning.rs` | the operator-priority wire: the thinking atoms (prefetch/deduction/syllogism/hypothesis/counterfactual/antithesis/synthesis/extrapolation/inference) as shipped graph ops, every unit of work a legal `KanbanMove` via `KanbanColumn::advance_on_gate` (Planning −550µs Σ-commit → CognitiveWork → Evaluation → Commit), `materialize` consuming `ThoughtCtx` read FROM the live graph, gestalt texture before/after (Chalmers emulation frame) |
| Exhibits | `contract/examples/cognitive_cycle.rs` · `contract/examples/recipe_dispatch_map.rs` (this doc's generator) · `lance-graph/examples/reasoning_loop.rs` (W-D: the loop reading a temporal stream) | runnable proof of each layer |

**Substrate split (rung-3 ladder row):** catalogue spine + kernels live HERE
(contract, zero-dep); the SIMD substrate primitives live in
`ndarray::hpc::styles` (`fn(Base17, NarsTruth) → result`) — **29 of 34
shipped**; missing exactly `RCR, TR, ASC, CAS, CR` (#4, 6, 7, 8, 11).

## §5 Where they wire — open edges (planned, gated)

| edge | status | gate |
|------|--------|------|
| **Kanban view updates, production** — the planner-side `Outcome`→`Candidate`/`KanbanMove` adapter | **deferred** (`style_strategy.rs:29`); example-tier wire shipped in `graph_self_reasoning.rs` | v3-kanban-executor-engineer territory (D-MBX-A6) |
| **MUL escalation → recipe** (`verdict_from(&MulAssessment)` → `select_tactic`/`materialize`) — the W-D production edge | designed, not wired | M-RUNG-1 pass + two-MUL reconcile (`.claude/plans/persistent-nars-kg-v1.md` W-D row) |
| **Rung fan → rung axis** (W-B `rung_candidates()` feeding `ctx.rung`) | probe not run | M-RUNG-1 |
| **StyleFamily(12) → recipe selection** — the TRUE rung-4→rung-3 `default_runbook` semantics | absent | persona-vs-rung-ladder **O2** (today's `default_runbook()` points at the persona vocabulary instead) |
| **Rung↔content wiring** (RungLevel knows Pearl depth, not content occupants) | absent | persona-vs-rung-ladder **O1** |
| Dissonance made causal in dispatch (finding 4 above), or documented as settle-only | undecided | next selector revision (with the #515 guard kept) |
